<p><b>A bit of myself:</b><br>
   I've always been fashinated about what's going on inside internet and computers. Since I was a kid, i used to watch my dad playing videogames on the pc, and i remember asking my self "How can we make such things? How is 
  possible???". Yeah, now I know how, and it's surely amazing. Everything that revolves around Internet/Computers is incredible. Form Telecommunications, to Web Architechture, to Operative Systems and videogames.
  But my career too a sharp turn, the day I discovered Robotics & Automations. In some way, my view of Internet was splitted. In one side I can clearly see how does internet work, from the copper to the server,
  and in the other I see how that copper was layed down. But how can such a huge
  infrastructure be even thought? And that's what i hope to be a part of. I'll explain myself better. What really amaze me, it's the incredibles steps ahead we take, as humanity, every day. We reach the stars from dirt.
  I want to contribute, even in a small way to make humanity a better place, to make science better, to the exploration of universe.<br>
