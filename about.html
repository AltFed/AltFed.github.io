<p><b>A bit of myself:</b><br>
  Since I was a kid, I used to record my TV while playing Cod BO2. I also used to do a live commentary like those youtubers i watched. <br>
  I don't know why, but I always liked the idea of being alone in my room, while also not being alone because of internet. <br>
  That's why I opened my twitch channel and started streaming while studying! We currently are 5-6 in my stream, but that's a lot more than i would have thought of. (Does this make sense inm English?)<br>
  <br>
  So that's what I do for now. I study, I stream, I go to the gym and I pet bilbo. Bye!
