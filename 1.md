# What is productivity for me, and why sometimes I hate it. 

The worst thing that a student can't find, in my opinion, is something like Notion. Obviously, Notion is a super-useful tool you can use
to get the most out of what, your mind has already processed. Notion (in my opinion :) ) is not meant to be used like a whiteboard, is not the solution for the puzzle that your schedule / study-method is. What i mean by this is that productivity tools, such as Notion, Obsidian, ToDoist and everything similar to them, are the last step of the process. 

The first problem that I encountered while using those tools is that, organizing or setting up one of them, makes you feel as good as accomplishing an hard task, even though the hardest think to do, is searchinig for the best template to copy.. xD
I call this phenomenon "Tunnel of Dopamine": you can't see the end, you'll never know when your Notion dashboard is "enough"; but only the idea of making your life easier by spending hours on choosing the best font to write your task, release as much dopamine as doing the work itself. 

This is why I separated the time spent on setting up those, and the time actually spent on work. In the end, I rejected every form of digital planning except for Google Calendar, where I write thing before transcribing them to my paper agenda. I just feel more connected to the things i plan and write if I use a pen and a sheet of paper. I also have all the freedom to do whatever I want on that piece of paper: I can make doodles, checkboxes, make arrows and everything like that, without worring that I may need a plugin to do that. 

The last thing that I belive, is that tools like Anki ( an application that let you create flashcards), are very useful *BUT* after the hard work. You can't study with Anki! It helps you memorizing the things you have already learnt and processed! 

There's no need to try an easier way, or one that make your life more complicated adding extra steps (choosing the best app, when you have pen&paper :/ ), when you just have to do the hard work.

(For all my fellow developers: Paper is open-source, no need to backup, no risk of losing it if there is a power down; the risks are fire, water! :p)
